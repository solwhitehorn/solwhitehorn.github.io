# Welcome, or Welcome back? 

A few years ago, I embarked on this journey by creating this website. My initial goal was simple: to share insights and discussions as I transitioned my entire setup to a Linux distribution. It was an exciting time, with Steam Proton gaining traction, and it was fascinating to explore the growing number of games that were suddenly accessible on Linux.

During that period, I wrote and published articles that gained significant traction on Google. Guides on configuring Xbox and Switch controllers on Ubuntu and Arch, as well as tutorials on MangoHUD, were widely read and appreciated. However, over time, these articles began to lose relevance. Linux distros have evolved considerably over the last five years, with improvements and changes that have made many of my older pieces obsolete. In fact, some of them now need to be archived or completely rewritten.

Then, life happened. My available time for writing and publishing articles dwindled, and producing showcase videos for YouTube became overwhelming. Eventually, a fateful GRUB update on my EndeavourOS system completely bricked my setup, and that was the final straw. That’s when I decided to step back and move on.

Since then, my workflow and daily computing experience have shifted. I transitioned to macOS, and surprisingly, I never looked back. While I still appreciate the flexibility of Linux, macOS has provided me with the stability and efficiency I needed for both work and personal life.


## Where do we go now?

So, what does this mean for the website moving forward? Well, I’m revamping the focus of this space, and here’s what you can expect:
- Tips and recommendations for useful apps on macOS.
- General discussions on gaming – Covering both macOS gaming and console experiences, from performance tweaks to personal game impressions.
- A touch of outdoor activities – Because gaming isn’t the only passion worth sharing; sometimes, stepping outside is just as rewarding.
- Who knows where this journey will take us next?

## The YouTube channel: a fresh start

As for my YouTube channel, I’ve decided to start fresh. My previous channel was heavily focused on Linux gaming, and given my current direction, it no longer aligns with what I want to create. If you’d like to follow along with my new content, you can find me here: [@solidor_](https://www.youtube.com/@solidor_)

## Another side project?
This might be something only my friends know about, but while exploring new ideas for my GitHub Pages, I created a small website showcasing digital pictures taken during my gaming sessions.

If you’re interested, feel free to check it out:
[Digitalscape](https://solwhitehorn.github.io/digitalscape/), where I’ll update some of my creations.

Stay tuned!
